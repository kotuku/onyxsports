</p>
<p>13.    Breaches of these terms and conditions
</p>
<p>13.1  Without prejudice to our other rights under these terms and conditions, if you breach these terms and conditions in any way, or if we reasonably suspect that you have breached these terms and conditions in any way, we may:

</p>

<p>16.1  If a provision of these terms and conditions is determined by any court or other competent authority to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the other provisions will continue in effect.
</p>

<p>Free website terms and conditions: drafting notes
</p>
<p>This is a free version of our standard website terms and conditions document. It is identical to that document, save that this version includes an SEQ legal credit.
</p>
<p>In addition to the provisions that would typically be included in any set of website terms and conditions, this document includes provisions covering user accounts and user-generated content (although the latter are not as detailed as in some of our more sophisticated website terms and conditions documents).
</p>
<p>If your website does not feature user accounts or interactive features, you may wish to consider our website disclaimer document instead of these terms and conditions.
</p>
<p>Section 1: Introduction
</p>
<p>Section 1.2
</p>
<p>Optional element.
</p>
<p>The completed document should be easily accessible on the website, with a link from every page.
</p>
<p>Section 1.3
</p>
<p>Optional element. Will all or any website users give their express consent to the terms of this document?
</p>
<p>Ideally, from a legal perspective, all users would be asked to expressly agree to the terms of the document. However, in practice, express consent is rarely sought from casual website visitors. On the other hand, it is easy to obtain the express consent of users who register with the website or submit any material to the website, eg by clicking "I accept" on an electronic version of the document. You should retain evidence of the acceptance of the document terms by each such user.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Under what circumstances will users be asked to give their express consent to the terms of this document?</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 1.4
</p>
<p>Optional element. Are there any age restrictions on the use of the website?
</p>
<p>The use of websites by minors can be legally problematic. There are a number of different legal issues. For example, under English law, contracts may be unenforceable against minors. Another issue concerns data protection. The law of data protection imposes additional burdens in relation to the processing of any personal data of a minor and personal data provided by a minor. The effects of the law of indecency may also depend upon whether a website is accessible by minors. Obviously, the inclusion of a requirement in your terms and conditions that minors refrain from using a website is no guarantee that they will do so. Where your website is directed at, or likely to be used by, minors, we recommend that you seek specialist legal advice.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>What is the minimum age for website users?</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 1.5
</p>
<p>Optional element. Does the website use cookies (including session cookies and third party cookies)?
</p>
<p>The inclusion of this statement in your website legal documents will not in itself satisfy the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (as amended) concerning consent to the use of cookies. Guidance concerning methods of obtaining such consent is included on the Information Commissioner's website (http://www.ico.gov.uk).

<p>Section 11.2
</p>
<p>Optional element.
</p>
<p>Section 12: Limitations and exclusions of liability
</p>
<p>Contractual limitations and exclusions of liability are regulated and controlled by law, and the courts may rule that particular limitations and exclusions of liability in contracts are unenforceable. The courts are particularly likely to intervene where a party is seeking to rely on a limitation or exclusion of liability in its standard terms and conditions, but will also sometimes intervene where a term has been individually negotiated. The courts may be more likely to rule that provisions excluding liability, as opposed to those merely limiting liability, are unenforceable. If there is a risk that any particular limitation or exclusion of liability will be found to be unenforceable by the courts, that provision should be drafted as an independent term, and be numbered separately from the other provisions. It may improve the chances of a limitation or exclusion of liability being found to be enforceable if the party seeking to rely upon it specifically drew it to the attention of the other party before the contract was entered into.
</p>
<p>Exclusions and limitations of liability in UK contracts are primarily regulated by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 ("UCTA"). Contracts regulated by UCTA cannot exclude or restrict a party's liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence (Section 2(1), UCTA). Except insofar as the relevant term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness, such contracts cannot exclude or restrict liability: (i) for negligence (which includes a breach of an express or implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or (ii) for misrepresentation (Section 3, Misrepresentation Act 1967). In addition, if a contract is regulated by UCTA, and one of the parties is dealing on the other's written standard terms of business, then except insofar as the relevant contractual term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness the other party cannot: (i) exclude or restrict his liability in respect of a breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of him; or (iii) claim to be entitled, in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual obligation, to render no contractual performance at all (see Section 3, UCTA). UCTA includes various other restrictions, particularly in the case of contracts for the sale of goods and contracts under which possession or ownership of goods passes. If you wish to try to limit/exclude for liability in respect of reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory breaches of contract, you should specify this in relation to the relevant provision (for example, using the following wording: "The limitations and exclusions of liability in this Clause [number] will apply whether or not the liability in question arises out of any reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory conduct or breach of contract"). In many circumstances, however, the courts will find these types of limitations and exclusions to be unenforceable. Somewhat different rules apply to limitations of liability in contracts with consumers, and these provisions should not be used in relation to such contracts. These guidance notes provide a very incomplete and basic overview of a complex subject. Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of liability.
</p>
<p>Section 12.1
</p>
<p>Do not delete this provision (except upon legal advice). Without this provision, the specific limitations and exclusions of liability in the document are more likely to be unenforceable.
</p>
<p>Section 12.3
</p>
<p>Optional element. Do you want to attempt to exclude all liability for free services and information?
</p>
<p>This sort of exclusion is quite common, but unlikely to be enforceable in court.
</p>
<p>Section 12.5
</p>
<p>Optional element.
</p>
<p>Section 12.6
</p>
<p>Optional element.
</p>
<p>Section 12.7
</p>
<p>Optional element.
</p>
<p>"Consequential loss" has a special meaning in English law: it means any loss that, whilst not arising naturally from the breach, was specifically in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.
</p>
<p>Section 12.8
</p>
<p>Optional element. If the website operator is a limited liability entity (eg a limited company), do you want to expressly exclude liability on the part of officers and employees?
</p>
<p>Section 13: Breaches of these terms and conditions
</p>
<p>Section 13.1
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Will account suspension or deletion be a possibility here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 13.2
</p>
<p>Optional element.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you wish to specify types of action that are prohibited here?</li>
	<li>Detail the types of action which are prohibited by this provision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 14: Variation
</p>

</p>
<p>Section 14.2
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Will website users be notified of changes to the document?</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 14.3
</p>
<p>Optional element. Will registered users be required to consent to variations?
</p>
<p>Section 17: Third party rights
</p>
<p>Optional element.
</p>
<p>This provision is designed to exclude any rights a third party may have under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
</p>
<p>Section 18: Entire agreement
</p>
<p>Section 18.1
</p>
<ul>
	<li>What other documents govern the use of the website?</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 19: Law and jurisdiction
</p>
<p>The questions of which law governs a document and where disputes relating to the document may be litigated are two distinct questions.
</p>
<p>Section 19.1
</p>
<p>This document has been drafted to comply with English law, and the governing law provision should not be changed without obtaining expert advice from a lawyer qualified in the appropriate jurisdiction. In some circumstances the courts will apply provisions of their local law, such as local competition law or consumer protection law, irrespective of a choice of law clause.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Which law should govern the document?</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 19.2
</p>
<p>In some circumstances your jurisdiction clause may be overridden by the courts.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Should the jurisdiction granted be exclusive or non-exclusive? Choose "non-exclusive" jurisdiction if you may want to enforce the terms and conditions against users outside England and Wales. Otherwise, choose "exclusive jurisdiction".</li>
	<li>The courts of which country or jurisdiction should adjudicate disputes under the document?</li>
</ul>

	<li>What authority supervises the authorisation scheme?</li>

</p>
<p>Optional element. Is the service provider a member of a regulated profession (eg solicitors)?
